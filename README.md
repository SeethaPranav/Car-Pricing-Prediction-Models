# Car-Pricing-Prediction-Models
Machine learning models for predicting car prices in the US market using regression techniques.

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for car prices in the US market, helping a Chinese automobile company understand the key factors influencing pricing and optimize their strategies accordingly. The company seeks to compete with US and European manufacturers by establishing a local production unit and requires insights into the variables affecting car prices in the American market, which may differ from those in China.

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset containing various features of cars in the US market is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed for further analysis.
2. **Model Implementation**: Five different regression models are implemented to predict car prices:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor
3. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using key metrics such as **R-squared**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. The best-performing model is identified based on these metrics.
4. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Significant features affecting car prices are identified through feature importance analysis to understand which variables have the most impact on price predictions.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters for the models are tuned to optimize performance and determine if the model's accuracy improves with better parameters.

The insights derived from this analysis will help the company understand the pricing dynamics in the US market and provide actionable strategies to align their vehicle designs, marketing, and pricing strategies with market expectations.

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook with code for data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and tuning, along with explanations of each step.
